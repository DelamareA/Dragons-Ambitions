List of 'commands' for the modules:
x, y, z are integers ; a, b, c are real values (such a 0.5) and s is a string (/!\ a string can't contain spaces, put a * if you want to put a space in a string /!\)

If you add a module, don't forget to increase the number of modules in 'global_index' and to add the new file in 'index'

id x
Set the id of the module to x (always the first command)

can_launch x
Indicate that the module can fire the object which id is x

can_detect x
Indicate that the module can detect units which type is x(0->bateau, 1->missile, 2->avion, 3->sub, 4->helico, 5->infanterie, 6->amphi, 7->batiment)

type x
Set the type of the module to x (0-> coque, 1->moteur, 2->lanceur, 3->reservoir, 4->radar, 5->personnel, 6->repair)

hitpoint x
Set the hp of the module (consider a scale from 1 to 4000)

fuel x
Set the maximum amount of fuel that the module can hold

radar_range x y
Set the radar range to detect enemy of type x (0->bateau, 1->missile, 2->avion, 3->sub, 4->helico, 5->infanterie, 6->amphi, 7->batiment) to y m

sight x
Set the 'sight' of the module (1 - 100)(used to detect enemy from a very short distance)

radar_power x y
Set the radar's power to detect enemy of type x to y (y is between 1 and 100)

radar_processing x a
Set the radar's processing value for enemies of type x (the real radar power used to detect enemies is the product of its power and processing values whereas only its power is used for enemy's passive radar, for a stealth radar, use a low radar_power and a high radar_processing)

radar_passive x
Set the power of the module passive radar to detect enemies (used to detect enemies which are using active radar) (x is between 0 and 100)

name s
Set the module's name to s

vulnerability a
Set the module's vulnerability to a (between 0 and 1)

repair_object x
Set how much repair to objects this module can perform each second

The following commands are only available for motors :

consumption a
Set the consumption of the module to a 'unit of fuel' per second

max_speed a
Set the maximum speed to a m/s

min_speed a
Set the minimum speed to a m/s

max_altitude a
Set the maximum altitude to a m

min_altitude a
Set the minimum altitude to a m

cruise_altitude a
Set the cruise altitude to a (this means that a unit with this module will go to this altitude when launched)

ascendant_angle a
Set the maximum angle during climb (or a descent) to a (in radian)

acceleration a
Set the acceleration to a m/s^2

deceleration a
Set the deceleration to a m/s^2 (this is used when the unit stops but still has fuel)

rotation_speed a
Set the maximum rotation speed to a radian/s

The following commands are only available for guidance modules :

fail_probability a
Set the probability of failing at each second of the flight (between 0 and 1, usually something like 0.01)

miss_probability a
Set the probability of failing when the missile reaches its target to a (between 0 and 1, usually something like 0.2)
